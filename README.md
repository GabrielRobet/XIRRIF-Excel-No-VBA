# XIRRIF-Excel-No-VBA
This is an exercise to emulate my XIRRIF Excel Function without any VBA. Here I only make use of standard Excel formulas like XIRR, INDIRECT, ADDRESS, and MATCH.

Like for the standard XIRR Excel Formula, the input data must be sorted firstly by **Range** (A to Z) and secondly by **Dates** (Oldest to Newest).


## Example
The downloadable Excel file includes an example with XIRRIF calculated for 5 funds, 50 investments and 800 cashflows.
